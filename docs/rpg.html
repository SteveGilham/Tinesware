    <article>        <h2>Tines' Dice v 1.1</h2>
        <img src="images/tinedice.png" title="Screen capture"
        alt="Screen for D&amp;D, RQ, Shadowrun, Vampire and Fulminata die rolling app"
        width="160" height="160" />

        <p>This is <a class="button" href="https://github.com/SteveGilham/Tinesware/blob/main/binaries/tdice1_1.zip" title="Download the archive">a simple PalmOS (3.5 or later)
        application</a> for die-rolling. You can roll pretty much any sort of
        dice (23d31, anyone?), but also has helper support for D&amp;D style
        games (roll a d20 to hit as well as the dice you ask), RQ style (roll
        a d% to hit and d20 hit location plus the dice), Hero (stun, body,
        3d6 to hit, 3d6 hit location) which could also be used for GURPS at a
        pinch (you have to do anything other than +0 or +1 adds in your
        head), Shadowrun (skill's worth of d6's in order) or Storyteller
        (skills worth of d10's in order), which could be used with Ars Magica
        or Godlike, though you have to do any funny die rolls or computation
        yourself.</p>

        <p>New at v1.1 - die rolling for <cite>Fvlminata</cite>, which uses
        Roman dice with values I,III,IV and VI. The screenshot shows a
        pre-release version; the full 1.1 shows Roman, rather than Arabic,
        numerals for the raw die tolls (the result sum is still in Arabic
        numerals). The program doesn't support re-rolling partial hands
        explicitly - to do this either remember which positions (or simply
        how many) you want to change, and record the ones kept and add in the
        appropriate positions or numbers in a new roll. I'd suggest using the
        effect roll from the re-roll, for obvious reasons.</p>

        <p>It's not a native program - you do need to install the Plua 1.0.17
        or later run-time (about 110k) from <a
        href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/plua/">the Yahoo plua group</a>,
        and probably MathLib.prc (which Plua uses for its mathematical
        support, another 55kb if you haven't got it installed as a helper for
        any other program yet).</p>

        <p>It is likely that you'll need MathLib at some point anyway, and it
        is quite it's likely that I'll be using Plua for other simple PalmOS
        utilities, because of its convenience.</p>

        <p>The outer .zip archive contains an inner one, plus a CTC
        signature, plus an explanation in a readme1st.txt file.</p>

        <p>The download above has the default Plua-powered large icon and the
        PalmOS default list icon. For a slightly larger download, you can get
        a <a class="button" href="https://github.com/SteveGilham/Tinesware/blob/main/binaries/iconpatch.zip" title="Download the extended die rolling program">version with a prettier set of icons</a>
        (b&amp;w and 8-bit colour) and the icon patching utility.  The format
        of the archive is the same two-level zip as the unmodified
        program.</p>

        <h2>Glorantha</h2>

        <p>EphemerisII - An unoffical <a href="ephem.html">Gloranthan
        Planetarium</a> Version 1.1 Coded &amp; copyright Mr. Tines This
        program is a separate implementation of the ideas of Greg Stafford
        based upon the original Gloranthan ephemeris program by Nick Brooke,
        whose star position data and holy day collation were invaluable. A
        number of transient (Sky Storm), unpredictable (Jugger), minor (One
        night wish), variable (Arkat) or just plain ill-defined (Ice Palace)
        features are not even attempted in this model.</p>

        <h2>Blue Planet</h2>

        <p>The <cite>Blue Planet</cite>RPG from <a
        href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070928060119/http://www.biohazardgames.com/bp.html">Biohazard
        Games</a> prides itself on hard science; some of the physics was run
        past the public in r.g.f.misc in summer of '96, and managed to get
        fine-tuned; indeed that is me in the first edition's "Special Thanks"
        credit. However, they didn't cover some important factors. In
        particular, the moons orbiting the eponymous blue planet are not
        stable in anything like the orbits given, with the instability
        showing over a period of 1-10 years. The following simulation
        emulates the moons of Lambda Serpentis II from the <cite>Blue
        Planet</cite> first edition rulebook; the parameters of the system
        are</p>
        <ul>

         <li>Lambda Serpentis II mass 6.799e24 kg
            diameter 13,750 km</li>
         <li>Moon a mass 9.827e23 kg,
            orbit radius 587400km period 47 days
            diameter 7,243 km</li>
         <li>Moon b mass 3.03e23 kg,
            orbit radius 825000km period 78.4 days
            diameter 4,960 km</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
         Earth mass = 5.976e24 kg, diameter 12,800 km</p>
        <p>
        The simulation uses a generalised N-body algorithm, converted to Java
        from the Fortran code by Sverre Aarseth and given in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Galactic-Dynamics-Edition-Princeton-Astrophysics/dp/0691130272">Binney &amp;
        Tremaine's <cite>Galactic Dynamics</cite></a>, in the first edition at least. Two instances are used in
        <a href="nbody.html" title="Planet and moon in applet">this applet</a> : the left hand display shows
        the system with the moons having negligible mass, and velocities for
        circular orbits as stated; the right has the moons with mass (and the
        planet with corresponding velocities to keep the centre of mass
        stationary in the display). </p>

        <p>The relative angle of the two moon at the start of the simulation
        can be controlled by the slider below (the figure above giving the
        separation in degrees), with the outer moon (grey) moving around its
        orbit (the outer light blue circle); while the inner moon (green)
        remains fixed in its orbit (inner light blue circle).</p>

        <p>The system is set running by hitting the button. The time elapsed
        in days is given in the line below the frame, plus the energy (in
        arbitrary units) of the massive system - which should remain
        constant, but will vary slightly due to compuational noise. A scale
        bar is given, and the displays rescale to fit any extreme excursione
        by any moon.</p>

        <p>If a moon is ejected from the system, or collides with another
        body this will be logged above the status line.</p>
