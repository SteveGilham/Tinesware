    <article><p>It is possible that there is a
problem with the primality testing under some compilers (notably
Visual C++ 5.0). This page gives a background on what is expected,
and what I've observed.</p>

<h1>RSA key generation</h1>

<p>When building an N-bit key, one has to compute two primes of length
N/2 bits. For a large number X, the number of primes less than X is
about X/ln(X); so the probability of a number near X being prime is
roughly 1/ln(X). Thus the probability of an N/2 bit number being
prime is thus approximately 1/ln(2**N/2), or roughly 2.8/N. We know
that even numbers can't be prime and don't generate them, so that
the probability of an odd number being prime is roughly 6/N.</p>
<p>To find two primes of this length will take <em>on average</em>,
therefore, about N/6 trials - about 200 for a 1024 bit key, about
3-400 for a 2048 bit key.</p>

<p>This applies to the simple scan (try every odd number starting
from a random base) and jump scan which starts with a given odd
number and steps by some even number greater than two.</p>

<p>Sophie Germain primes are primes P such that 2P+1 is also a
prime; CTClib's Sophie Germain prime generation method for RSA
keypairs produces a key pair whose primes are of the form 2P+1 for
some smaller prime. This yields some theoretical benefits for the
resistance of the keys to analysis. However, such primes are
comparatively sparse.</p>

<p>We observe that P has to be of the form 6K-1 for some K, as is
2P+1; meaning that we sample from a population from which we have
discarded multiples of 3 as well as multiples of 2, and so have a
probability of about 8/N of being prime.</p>

<p>So we want to generate an N/2 bit prime X, so that Y = (X-1)/2
is also prime - Y is thus an N/2 - 1 bit value. Assuming no
correlation, between them, then the probability that X and Y are
both prime is approximately 70/N^2, so generating a keypair will
take <em>on average</em> approximately N^2/70 attempts - about
15,000 tries for a 1024 bit keypair, about 50,000 tries for a 2048
bit keypair. This can take a substantial time.</p>

<h1>Timings</h1>

<p>Using a debug build under Borland C++Builder3, simple-scan RSA
keypairs have taken the expected number of trials, and, on a 200MHz
MMX processor a few tens of seconds for 1024 and 2048 bit keys. For
a 1024-bit Sophie-germain pair, tests have run between 10,000 and
25,000 attempts and a few tens of minutes : a 2048-bit Sophie
Germain keypair is probably an overnight job (four times as many
trials, and large numbers of twice the size, and hence slower to
manipulate).</p>
<p>Some speed-up of primality testing is possible, to reduce the
number of large integer operations performed in the initial
checking against small prime factors though it would take some
significant reworking of the code.</p></article>
