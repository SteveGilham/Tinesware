<p><a href="https://github.com/SteveGilham/Tinesware/blob/main/binaries/drophash.zip"
title="Drag and drop multiple file hashing tool">Drophash</a> &#8212; a simple
pure Win32 program written in modern C++ and built with VC++2010.  Both
executable and source in a .zip file &#8212; drag and drop files onto the
program icon or window, and get their MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashes, which
you can copy and paste. Freely redistributable.</p>

<h2 id="xpp">XPP (<a href="https://github.com/SteveGilham/Tinesware/tree/main/xpp">abandoned</a>)</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/SteveGilham/Tinesware/blob/main/binaries/xpp.zip">XPP 1.0.1708.27390</a> &#8212; An X(HT)ML
preprocessor for helping handle repetitive bits in static web pages.</p>
<pre>
Usage: xpp "directives" in-filename out-location

Example: "+local -remote include *replace" ..\..\New.html ..\..\bin</pre>

<p>out-location may be a file or a directory. If the latter, the file-name of
the in-filename is used to create the new file. The directives indicate which
parts of the file to change.</p>

<p>The in-file has to be valid XML; and in most cases it can be valid XHTML.
Each element tag is inspected for a "class" attribute.</p>
<ol>
  <li><h3>If/else sections of the file</h3>
    <p>If the class value is one of the strings marked with a '+' in the
    directive, the attribute is just removed.</p>
    <p>If the class value is one of the strings marked with a '-' in the
    directive, the whole element and all it contains is removed.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Including text</h3>
    <p>These are more complicated. Class attributes are of the form</p>
    <pre>
directive facet1 facet2 ... facetN</pre>
    <p>where facet1/facet2/.../facetN is the filespec (typically a relative
    one) from in-filename to the file to include.</p>
    <p>If the directive matches a *-ed value, replace the element with the
    contents of the file; if the match is with an un-tagged name, replace the
    contents of the element with the contents of the file.</p>
    <p>If the included file isn't a valid XML fragment, then the process will
    fail.</p>
    <p>Note that the evaluation carries on through the included XML,
    recursively, so an included fragment can have If/else sections.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There isn't any fancy error handling. If you choose a bad file location,
or the XML isn't well formed, it will just fail with a traceback.</p>

<p>Neither will it perform any validation against DOCTYPE elements.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN"
       "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;No title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta class="replace .. xpp header.ihtml" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p class="local"&gt;Local&amp;nbsp;text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="remote"&gt;Remote text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="display"&gt;styled text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="include .. xpp other.ihtml"&gt;Insertion point&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

<p>When processed as above, will become</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd"&gt;

<p>Use it to factor out common bits of headers, repeated modules like page
footers, and make the bits visible by applying CSS styles to the affected
tags (doesn't work so well on &lt;head /&gt; tags).</p>

<h2 id="janusnet">Janus/.NET  (<a href="https://github.com/SteveGilham/Tinesware/tree/main/janus.net">abandoned</a>)</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/SteveGilham/Tinesware/blob/main/binaries/janus.net.zip">Janus/.NET</a> &#8212; A
re-implementation of my <a href="janus.html">Janus</a> program using the .NET
framework's asynchronous I/O facilities that make writing an industrial
strength server a trivial exercise. [for certain values of trivial, says he

<h2 id="validator">Validator ( (<a href="https://github.com/SteveGilham/Tinesware/tree/main/validator">abandoned</a>))</h2>

<p>My first .NET project release &#8212; <a href="https://github.com/SteveGilham/Tinesware/blob/main/binaries/validator.zip"
title="XHTML validator in .NET">an XHTML validator</a> that will check a
document against 1.0 Transitional, 1.0 Strict and 1.1, all without needing to
edit your DOCTYPE. Useful for polishing before sending to the W3C validator.
New version 1.1 (17-May-03) also checks for invalid characters in the
0x80-0x9F range that cp1252, the usual Microsoft character encoding, uses and
are often included in the belief that they are part of utf-8 (ISO Latin-1).
The characters involved are shown in the following <a href="cp1252.html"
title="Windows CP1252 non-SGML characters">conversion chart.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/SteveGilham/Tinesware/blob/main/binaries/validator-2_1.zip"
title="XHTML+CSS validator in .NET">Version 2.1 also available</a> which
performs CSS level 2 validation and will validate all the XHTML files in a
folder (optionally in all sub-folders too). This uses the Java code from the
W3C validator built under J#, so you'll need to have the J# redistributables
as well as the .Net framework from Microsoft installed to make use of this.
The archive also contains my C# source, the Java files I changed, and tools
sufficient to take the W3C 19-May-01 archive, patch it, and build the CSS2
support DLL.</p>

<h2 id="shload">SHLoad &#8212; old-style skinning (Very abandoned and obsolete)</h2>

<p>Even the source of this obsolete program is lost, except as bundled in an antique installer of dubious provenance.  As it involved Borland classes, it's probably not even worth running in on a VM and seeing what I get &#8212; you're better off going to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-C-Windows-Shell-Programming/dp/1861001843">Esposito <cite>Visual C++ Windows Shell Programming</cite></a>.</p>

<h2 id="passiveftp">Passive FTP  (<a href="https://github.com/SteveGilham/Tinesware/tree/main/passiveftp">abandoned</a>)</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/SteveGilham/Tinesware/blob/main/binaries/passiveftp-1_11.zip"
title="Firewall friendly FTP app">PassiveFTP 1.11</a> &#8212; build 1.11.2971.37821
&#8212; mitigates the upload rate problem I've been having, by doing
some unexpectedly effective tweaks to socket parameters (the boost came
by sending only small packets and disabling Nagle coalescence).  Default
upload rate is 128kb/s (1ms sleep between successful sends of 128-byte packets),
which gave the best rate for me.</p>

<p>PassiveFTP 1.10 &#8212; build 1.10.2734.38706
&#8212; squeezes in an up-one-level button into the remote site list,
for FTP sites that manage to conceal their ".." directories.  Or for
people who'd prefer it anyway.</p>

<p>PassiveFTP 1.9 &#8212; build 1.9.2360.19246
&#8212; is a minor usability tweak, moving status indications from dialogs to the
main screen &#8212; progress at the lower-left, errors in the scrolling text at top
right.</p>

<p>PassiveFTP 1.8 &#8212; build 1.8.2127.30224 &#8212; minor bug-fix release &#8212; only
treats client-side executables as possibly having unique icons, so does not
get icon creation failures when scanning client-side folders with very many
files. Also set default upload to dial-up compatible 2kb/s for best observed
stability.</p>

<p>PassiveFTP 1.7 &#8212; build 1.7.1955.38236 &#8212; minor enhancement release &#8212;
allows the upload rate to be reduced so as not to overwhelm fussy servers.</p>

<p>PassiveFTP 1.6 &#8212; build 1.6.1701.15662 &#8212; minor bug-fix release &#8212;
works with other than 32-bit screen depth on Windows. Tested only on 16-bit
default case on XP. Should handle 16, 24 and 32 bit screen depths.</p>

<p>PassiveFTP 1.5 &#8212; minor bug-fix release &#8212; this fixes an issue whereby
after some use, screen corruption would occur, with a "Could not create icon"
message box. This turned out to be GDI exhaustion by putting server-side
icons in the client icon cache, and thus having to regenerate individual
icons for each file on the server, each time the view changed!</p>

<p>PassiveFTP 1.4 &#8212; minor bug-fix release &#8212; if a logon to a new server
was abandoned by terminating the program, the current server would be set to
the new one &#8212; but on restart this would cause an out-of-range error, as
there would be no stored server details.</p>

<p>PassiveFTP 1.3 &#8212; Has improved file icon display for files on the client
(using a couple of encapsulation-busting getting at the internals of library
classes) for Win32 to show the actual file icon, and the facility to localize
all the messages through text files by using a patched version of FOX 1.1.41
in which all user-facing strings are exposed to application code for
modification.</p>

<p>Because of the possible changes to the strings at later releases, this and
all later builds of PassiveFTP stick to 1.1.41. The patches to allow L10N are
to make every hard-coded string or icon a static member of the class, instead
of being in-line, then extracting all the initializations so they can be
re-done with localized strings/icons.</p --></article>
