<p>This is in response to a correspondant of mine whose mail I
managed to lose inbetween inconsistent e-mail filtering passes,
asking after the useful General Frenetics page that I once linked
to. That page, giving a simple "how to" has vanished into Google's
cache, aand this page is a sort-of replacement. It is most
definitely not meant as a substitute for the Ciphersaber FAQ.</p>

<p>I'll assume that if you're reading this, you have some idea of
what encryption is, and why it is useful to everyone (unless you're
the sort of person with a webcam running in your bathroom).</p>

<h2>Description of Ciphersaber version 1</h2>

<p>Ciphersaber (v1) is a simple program based on turning a shared
secret pass phrase - longer and harder to guess than a
pass<em>word</em> - into a key for the ARCFOUR algorithm. ARCFOUR is
the name used for the reverse engineered algorithm that appears to
interoperate with the RSA Security algorithm called RC4.</p>

<p>ARCFOUR is one of the simplest forms of strong (hard to decrypt
without having the key) symmetric (same key used to encrypt and
decrypt) cipher. The fact that you have to use the same key at both
ends means that you have to find some means to agree a key with
your correspondent, unlike the well known <a
href="pgp.html" title="What I think about the Pretty Good Privacy program">PGP</a>
(for which you can give away the encryption
key, without permitting decryption of messages sent to you).</p>

<p>In the implementation we shall be dealing with three chunks of
information:</p>

<ul>
<li>the message text, which we are going to encrypt (assumed to be
a file, which may contain either text or binary data)</li>

<li>the passphrase, entered by the user, needed to encrypt and
decrypt the message</li>

<li>the initialization vector (or more strictly speaking, the
salt), which is simply a string of 10 characters, chosen at random
every time a message is encrypted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The passphrase</h3>

<p>First, the program must allow the user to enter the passphrase.
The passphrase is a line of characters - it could be made up of one
or more words, including alphabetic characters, digits, spaces and
punctuation marks.</p>

<p>At this point we get into the murky world of character sets and
their representations, because ARCFOUR only understands the
manipulation of byte values (i.e. numbers in the range 0-255; or
alternatively from -128 to +127, if numbers that would be grater
than 127 are treated as if they were 256 less, for those using
Java). The simplest representation is the American ASCII standard
which gives character meanings to numeric values 32 to 126, for the
alphabet, both lower (a-z) and upper (A-Z) case, numbers and common
punctuation. For Western European languages, the ISO-Latin-1
character set defines values for common accented characters, and
covers the range up to 255. Eastern European languages give
different values to the higher values. Oriental languages like
Japanese of Chinese have to use more than one byte to represent a
character.</p>

<p>Unless you can be sure that your correspondent is using the same
character set as you, then it is safest to stick to ASCII for a
passphrase. Note that your passphrase will still be case sensitive
- the letter 'a' is a different value to the letter 'A'; so
"SECRET" is not the same value as "SecreT".</p>

<p>The only limitation on the passphrase is that it and the salt
must together be no more than 256 bytes (so 246 characters in ASCII
or ISO-Latin variants, Greek and Russian, 123 characters in
multi-byte languages) ; and the longer it is, the better - English
text has about 1 bit of entropy per character, so that anything
much less than 64 characters would be fairly easy to break. The
original author of CipherSaber recommended that the length of the
passphrase should not exceed 54 letters, to ensure it gets
well-mixed with the ten bytes of the initialization vector.</p>

<p>In 'C' the byte values will just be the char[] read in; for Java
you'll need to use String.toByteArray() and agree a character
encoding. For other languages, you're on your own - use the
Ciphersaber test messages.</p>

<h3>The salt</h3>

<p>Next, your program needs to generate the initialization vector
or salt - this is simply a sequence of ten random bytes. Since the
values will be made public, it is probably not necessary to use
anything more heavy-duty than is already available as part of the
language environment for pseudo-random number generation
(java.util.Random, or rand(), or rnd() will do just fine for
generating it in the encryption stage).</p>

<p>The purpose of the salt is to allow a fixed passphrase to be
re-used. If part of the key were not changed every time, then
having two different messages would allow the common encryption to
be factored out. The salt is simply appended to the byte values
extracted from passphrase to form the key. When encrypting, you
write these 10 bytes as the first values in the encrypted file;
when decrypting you read it as the first ten bytes of the file.</p>

<p>Since these values are themselves reasonably random, they are
not distinguishable from the rest of the file - a third party will
have to know that this is a ciphersaber encrypted file; it is not
apparent from the file itself (unlike ZIP or GIF, or even PGP
files, for example). This means your program will have to enable
the user to tell it whether it is encrypting or decrypting a given
file. One way of doing this is to have the encrypted files have a
".CS1" suffix, and associate files of this type and the decryption
mode of operation.</p>

<h3>ARCFOUR</h3>

<p>The algorithm used is simple yet strong. Its one weakness is
that some information about the key does leak out in the first few
hundred bytes of the encrypted message. This is generally not of
practical use, but in a system like Cipersaber v1 in which similar
keys are used (just changing the salt), practical attacks have been
mounted, aimed against similar encryption systems used in Wi-Fi
networking. We will deal with this problem later in discussing
version 2.</p>

<p>The algorithm works in two stages - first you set it up with the
key; next you run it to generate the keystream - the actual values
used to encrypt your message.</p>

<p>As note above, everything works on bytes. I'll assume you're
usign an integer type that can represent 0-255 (for Java people,
use anything but byte here, unless you know what you're doing). We
shall be doing a lot of arithmetic modulo 256 - this simply means
that after doing any arithmetic, if the answer is 256 or more,
subtract 256, repeating until we're back in the 0-255 range. For
negative numbers keep adding 256 instead. I'll also assume that
array indexing works from 0 - if it works from 1, like in Fortran,
simply add 1 to each array index.</p>

<p>The ARCFOUR <strong>state</strong> is an array of 256 byte
values. The <strong>key</strong> is the array generated from the
passphrase plus the salt; the <strong>key_length</strong> is the
length of this array. We have two worker values, that we will call
<strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>.</p>

<h4>Set-up</h4>

<p>Fill the State array with 256 values from 0 to 255 in ascending
order. The first cell of the array will acquire the value of zero,
the second cell the value of one etc; the last cell will hold the
value of 255.</p>

<p>Initialize both <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> to
zero.</p>

<p>The <strong>state</strong> array will now undergo 256 mixing
operations. Use a variable called K to hold the number of the
current operation. The first time the loop runs, K will equal zero;
the second time through the loop K will equal one, etc.</p>

<ol>
<li>To the variable <strong>B</strong> (whose initial value was
zero but will now change) add the value of the <strong>A</strong>th
element of the <strong>key</strong> and the Kth element of
<strong>state</strong>. (Remember that all additions must be
performed modulo 256, unless a particular section states
otherwise.)</li>

<li>Swap the values of the Kth element and the <strong>B</strong>
th element of <strong>state</strong> - so if state[K] was 23 and
state[B] was 42 before, after state[K] will be 42, snd state[B],
23.</li>

<li>Increment the value of A by one. If <strong>A</strong> is above
<strong>key_length</strong> subtract
<strong>key_length</strong> from <strong>A</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>When that is done, reset <strong>A</strong> and
<strong>B</strong> to zero.</p>

<h4>Generating the key stream</h4>

<p>For each byte in the data to encrypt or decrypt do this</p>

<ol>
<li>increment <strong>A</strong> by one (modulo 256, as
always)</li>

<li>increment <strong>B</strong> by the value of the
<strong>A</strong>th element of <strong>state</strong></li>

<li>Swap the values of the <strong>A</strong>th element and the
<strong>B</strong> th element of <strong>state</strong></li>

<li>Generate our magic number for this time around as the sum of
the <strong>A</strong>th element and the <strong>B</strong> th
element of <strong>state</strong> (you can do this before the swap
if you want)</li>

<li>The next byte of the keystream is the magic number'th element
of <strong>state</strong></li>

<li>XOR that value and the input byte, and write it to the
output</li>
</ol>

<p>If you haven't an obvious XOR operator you need to do it
manually like this</p>

<ol>
<li>Extract the 128's place of the state value - it's 1 if the
number is &gt; 127, otherwise zero. If it's 1, subtract 128</li>

<li>Extract the 64's place - it's 1 if the number is now over 63,
else zero. Subtract 64 if the it's 1.</li>

<li>Similarly extract the 32s, 16s, 8s, 4s, 2s and 1s places.</li>

<li>Do the same for the data value.</li>

<li>Compare the values, place by place. If they are the same the
output value for the place is 0, otherwise 1.</li>

<li>Build up from 0 by adding 128 if the 128's place is 1, 64 if
the 64's place is 1 and so forth.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>The whole point of Ciphersaber is that it's a home-build
program, using an algorithm that could fit as the slogan on a
coffee mug, so I'm not going to supply source - if you have to, I'm
sure Google will turn up an ARCFOUR implementation in your chosen
language, but that spoils the fun.</p>

<p>If you are new to programming, you can work up to implementing
Ciphersaber in stages. Start with a program that just copies a file
byte by byte; then one that adds or removes the 10 byte random
header; finally perform the encryption or decryption.</p>

<p>Do take care with array indexing - it is so easy to be
off-by-one; and since the whole point of encryption is to generate
random output, it's hard to tell if you have the <em>right</em>
random. Use Google to look for RC4 test vectors, and use the
Cipehrsaber test messages.</p>

<h2>Description of Ciphersaber version 2</h2>

<p>CipherSaber-2 is a modification to Ciphersaber-1 that addresses
concerns about weaknesses in RC4. In CipherSaber-2 the entire state
array mixing loop is repeated N times, where N is a number that the
sender and receiver agree upon. When N=1, CipherSaber-2 is the same
as CipherSaber-1. Following the attack, using CipherSaber-2 in
place of CipherSaber-1, with a value of N=20 or more is
recommended.You should first implement CipherSaber-1 and verify
that it works using the text vectors on the main CipherSaber page.
It is then a simple matter to modify your program to do
CipherSaber-2, and use the test message in the Ciphersaber FAQ to
verify the implementation.</p>

<p>In our description above, simply run the loop of 256 mixing
operations through N times, without resetting <strong>A</strong>
and <strong>B</strong> until all N operations are done.</p>

<p>The value of N must be agreed by sender and receiver - it is not
written to the file - otherwise the N=1 state would not be the same
as Ciphersaber-1.</p>
