EphemerisII - A Gloranthan Planetarium
Version 1.2 for Java 1.1+ Coded & copyright Mr. Tines <tines@windsong.demon.co.uk> 1998-2002
This program is a separate implementation of the ideas of Greg Stafford
based upon the original Gloranthan ephemeris program by Nick Brooke
<Nick_Brooke@compuserve.com>, whose star position data and holy day collation
were invaluable.

A number of transient (Sky Storm), unpredictable (Jugger), minor (One night
wish), variable (Arkat) or just plain ill defined (Ice Palace) features are
not even attempted in this model.
