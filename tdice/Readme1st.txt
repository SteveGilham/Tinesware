IMPORTANT If you have installed v1.0, you should first 
========= delete that from your PDA (either though the 
launcher, or a utility like Filez or Tom's Catalog).  
This is due to a problem to do with case sensitivity 
of file and program names - installing v1.1 with v1.0
present, the new version will just be masked by rather 
than replace the v1.0 executable.
